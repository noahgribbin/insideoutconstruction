          <h3><span>Inside Out Construction, LLC</span> is a family owned and operated team of carpenters based in <span>Lynnwood, Washington</span>, serving <span>North King,</span> and <span>South Snohomish</span> Counties with several decades of experience in the construction trades.</h3>
          <p>We established Inside Out with the conviction that we could design and create an excellent product at a fair and reasonable price.  We still understand that any project, regardless of its scope or magnitude, begins with a homeowner's vision of improving his or her living space and enjoyment of their home.  It isn't lost on us that these are big decisions and considerable investments.  We do all we can to achieve YOUR goals; we're with you every step of the way, answering questions about design and materials and applications, offering suggestions or just talking about the weather.  Our approach is:  This is your project and we welcome whatever level of involvement makes you comfortable.</p>
